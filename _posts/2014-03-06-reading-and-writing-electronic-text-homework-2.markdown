My goal for assignment #2 was to make a cut-up method that still creates flowing text. To create a
flowing text, I employed two cut-up methods, one operating on lines and a second operating on
tokens, to connect cut-up parts by matching starting and ending sounds.

The first method scans in all the lines of a text and remembers each line by the first character in
the first word using a Python dictionary. Then, it chooses a random starting line. Once a line is
picked, it examines the line's last character, which it uses to randomly pick a connecting line. The
first and last characters of neighboring lines must match. If a suitable neighbor cannot be found,
it starts a new stanza with a new random line.

For example:

> We went to the even**t**.
>
> **T**ime knows no bound**s**.
>
> **S**ee you tomorrow.

The second method modifies the lines chosen by the first method by examining intermediate words and swapping them out with a random word from the original text that matches its first and last letters to the last letter of the previous word and first letter of the next word.

For example:

> Twitter proclaim**s** *its* **d**estiny.

becomes:

> Twitter proclaim**s** **s**unne**d** **d**estiny.

Please see the [README](https://github.com/robertsdionne/rwet/tree/master/hw2#readme) for
instructions to use hw2.py.

I chose to use [Dr. Seuss childrens' books](https://github.com/robertsdionne/rwet/blob/master/hw2/
drseuss.txt) as input because their rhythmic quality pairs well with the flowing aspect of the
generated texts.

[reading1.txt](https://github.com/robertsdionne/rwet/blob/master/hw2/reading1.txt) is an example
output:
